# Problem size configurations
# Option 1: Named sizes (small, medium, large) - 3 sizes
sizes:
  small:
    num_agents: 5
    num_items: 5
  medium:
    num_agents: 10
    num_items: 10
  large:
    num_agents: 20
    num_items: 20

# Option 2: Grid of sizes (uncomment to use 3x3 = 9 sizes)
# This creates all combinations of agents and items
# sizes_grid:
#   agents: [10, 20, 50]
#   items: [10, 20, 50]
