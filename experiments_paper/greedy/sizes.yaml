# Problem size configurations
# Option 1: Named sizes (small, medium, large) - 3 sizes
# sizes:
#   small:
#     num_agents: 5
#     num_items: 5
#   medium:
#     num_agents: 10
#     num_items: 10
#   large:
#     num_agents: 20
#     num_items: 20

# Option 2: Grid of sizes for scaling analysis
# 3x3 = 9 sizes gives comprehensive scaling but VERY wide table (46 cols, needs landscape)
# Alternative: 6 selective sizes for cleaner presentation
sizes_grid:
  agents: [5, 10, 20]
  items: [10, 20]
# Or uncomment for full 3x3 grid:
# sizes_grid:
#   agents: [10, 20, 30]
#   items: [10, 20, 30]
