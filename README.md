# Combinatorial Discrete Choice Model Estimation

A comprehensive implementation of parametric estimation methods for combinatorial discrete choice models. This repository provides efficient estimation algorithms using user-provided oracles and advanced optimization techniques, with full support for parallel computing using MPI.

---

## Overview

The estimation procedure requires two user-provided oracles (functions or class methods):

- **Features Oracle:** A user-defined function or class method that computes the feature vector for each bundle.
- **Demand Oracle:** A user-defined function or class method that computes the demanded bundle at candidate parameter values.

The demand oracle supports integration with **Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) solvers** for solving complex subproblems. The repository includes a comprehensive library of built-in subproblem solvers:

- **Greedy algorithms** - Fast approximate solutions for various problem types
- **Quadratic supermodular optimization** - Network flow and LovÃ¡sz extension methods
- **Linear knapsack** - Standard knapsack problem solver
- **Plain single item** - Basic single-item choice optimization
- **Unconstrained supermodular optimization** - Specialized algorithms for supermodular functions
